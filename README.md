![REPORT](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8577b9e3-b098-4825-9531-3bf1248c3139)






###Insight
o	Electronics and Computers & Accessories dominate in potential revenue (₹97B and ₹12B respectively) and number of reviews.
o	Multiple Amazon Basics products lead in both rating and volume of reviews, indicating strong customer trust and repeat purchases.
o	Over 60% of products are rated 4.0 to 4.3, signaling general customer satisfaction.
o	Products with very high discounts (80–90%) show lower ratings, suggesting possible quality concerns or inflated pricing tactics.
o	A few top-rated products (HDMI cables, earphones) generate disproportionate engagement.
o	High-performing SKUs combine strong ratings with massive review counts, driving visibility and sales.
o	Most products fall into the ₹200–₹500 or >₹500 price buckets.
o	311 products have <1,000 reviews — these may be new, under-marketed, or underperforming.






### Recommendation
   -	Prioritize marketing for high-rated, high-review products in Electronics and Accessories.
   -	Bundle or cross-sell with similar items to increase cart value.
   -	Investigate products with >80% discounts and poor ratings. These may harm brand perception and should be re-evaluated.
   -	Focus on the ₹200–₹500 segment where many strong products exist with room for growth.
   -	Use promotional campaigns to increase visibility and reviews for those <1,000-review products.
   -	Analyze review content of top-rated and low-rated products to extract specific improvement or marketing cues (e.g.,             durability, compatibility).
   -	Offer moderate discounts (20–50%) which maintain high ratings and attract conversions, avoiding over-reliance on deep cuts.
